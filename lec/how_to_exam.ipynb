    "Use of the recursive leap of faith to say, \"I know the rest of my function works, so what do I need to do right now to combine my recursive calls, possibly with my current state?\" For example, sometimes you just sum the recursive calls together, but other times you may want to also do something to your final return value by also considering what the current state is.\n",

    "### Pointers (lists and Linked Lists):\n",
    "Anytime you see just an = (not a +=), know that you are (re)drawing a pointer or (re)assigning a value. Ask yourself, what does the thing on the right equal? If it is an object, then we now point to that object (but do not destroy what the original thing was pointed to because other things may be pointed to it too). If it is a primitive value, then we directly evaluate to that value and are not related to the variable on the right in any way (I say this because if we set a variable equal to another variable that is a pointer, then both are pointing to the same thing, so they are related).\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot reassign a global non-primitive value variable within a local frame, you can only mutate it. Thus, you can never destroy an object from within a function, you could only mutate it. For instance, saying `link = link.rest` from within a **local frame** does not actually reassign the global link variable (assuming that you created a Linked List called link in the global frame), it just (re)assigns the local link so that it now equals its rest, but the global link remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. The worst thing you could ever do to a Linked List in the global frame from within a function is set its .rest=Link.empty, however, you could never destroy the entire Linked List because that would require reassigning the global variable.\n",

    "If a variable points to something, then do not think of that variable as the actual type of the thing it points to. For example, if it points to a list, do not think of the variable as a list itself, but rather, as a pointer to that list. Thus, if we set something equal to that variable, then we are setting it equal to a pointer to that same thing. In other words, the object itself is more important than the variable name because multiple variables can point to the same object.\n"

    "Please never return or set a variable equal to a append, extend, or remove call because they evaluate to None\n",
    "\n",
    "append takes in one value whose type is anything, adds one box to the list, and puts that thing in the list. The closest thing to this is (make sure the list we are adding is only one element):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "lst = lst + [x]; reassigns lst though, so be careful doing this within a function \n",
    "\n",
    "lst += [x]; not a reassignment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "extend takes in an iterable, counts the amount of boxes in that iterable, adds those boxes to the end of the list, and evaluates each element of the iterable we are passing in and adds it to each box. This relates heavily to the \"Pointers\" section because if an individual element is a pointer, then our list's element will point to the exact same thing. Note that += with a list works the same way as extend, meaning that the right side must be a list itself too. The closest thing to extend is (the list we are adding can be as many elements as you would like):\n",

    "extend and append are fundamentally different, so please do not think that calling them on the exact same arguments will do the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    " list(...) takes in one element that must be an iterable and makes a copy of that list. It follows a similar procedure to extend where it counts how many boxes it needs to make, then evaluates each element of the argument and puts it into each box. Thus, this relates heavily to the \"Pointers\" section because if an individual element is a pointer, then our list's element will point to the exact same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing ([... : ...]) works just like list(...) in that it creates a copy of that list (taking into account the start and endpoint) counts how many boxes it needs to make, then evaluates each element of the argument and puts it into each box. Slicing always returns a list. For example, lst[0:1] is the same as [lst[0]].\n",

    "#### List Addition\n",
    "Regular list addition (lst = [...] + [...], not lst+=[...]) involves adding the number of boxes of each list on the right, creating a new list with that amount of boxes (the total amount on the right side), and evaluating each element one by one just like we did for extend, list(...), and slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Counting Boxes\n",
    "Look at the big list (the outer [ and ]) and count how many commas are in between. The total amount of boxes/elements is the number of commas that separate each element plus 1. Note, do not count the commas in nested lists. \n",
    "\n",

    "Go to the Python Tutor and practice making random list manipulations and using == (asks if the objects look the same) and is (asks if the objects point to the same thing).\n",

    "\n",
    "Whenever we use print(...) or {...} in an f string, we call str(...) on the argument, and then remove the outer quotes\n",
    "\n",
    "repr(...) is implicitly called whenever we just the type the name of an object in the terminal. This does not display the outer quotes (but it will display inner ones if there are any).\n",
    "\n",
    "repr(...) is explicitly called whenever we literally write repr(...) and always adds an extra layer of quotes on the outside.\n",

    "You can only call certain functions on them (.branches, is_leaf() etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "If your function asks to pass in a tree, do not pass in .branches because .branches is a list, not a tree.\n",

    "Exponential: tree recursion (examples: fib, count_park, any recursive problem that does multiple recursive calls in each frame)\n",
    "\n",
    "Quadratic: double for loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for x in lst:\n",
    "      for y in lst:\n",
    "          # code\n",

    "Linear: any function that does something N times where N is the size of in the input (example: iterating over the list, a while loop that waits until n is 0 and decrements n by 1 each time)\n",

    "Logarithmic: any function where you have to double the size of the input in order to make it run one more time\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (log_func(2) and log_func(3) run the same amount of times. In order to make it run one more time, we would have to do log_func(4), which is 2*2)\n",

    "def log_func(n):\n",
    "     while n > 0:\n",

    "Aggregation Iterators\n",
    "These functions return iterators, so be careful when you assign a value or return a map(...) for example. Instead, what you may actually want to do is return a list(map(...)) \n",

    "\n",
    "Extra Tips\n",
    "Sometimes you may encounter a line where you see that you need to do a lot in one line. In that case, consider using a lambda function, list comprehension, and/or (sometimes these things can be used together) an aggregation function. But please be careful aggregating on trees because there is no such thing as a max of trees and there is no way to sum a tree because they are not integers.\n",

    "General\n",
    "Read the problem and doctests thoroughly. You cannot solve a problem if you do not even know what it is asking of you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach each problem from the following standpoint: CS 61A is not a Programming course, it is a logic/critical thinking course that happens to be taught in Python. Thus, first ask yourself, \"what does this function need to do in order to achieve its goal?\" Then ask, \"how can I do this in Python?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand the type of the inputs and outputs of your function. If it takes in a list, make sure you always pass a list into it. If it returns a nested list, please return a nested list no matter what (for example, your base case may return a [[]])\n",
