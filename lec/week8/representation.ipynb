It is based on the MPI standard, a widely used communication protocol for parallel computing. MPI allows different processes to communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages, making it suitable for distributed memory systems like clusters and supercomputers. With mpi4py, users can write parallel Python code that leverages the power of multiple processors to solve complex problems more efficiently. \n"
