    "#### Iterators \n",
    "- append and extend add to lists\n",
    "- a slice of a list is always a list \n",
    "- you can only put numbers in a list, and you can change the numbers, and you can only add lists and numbers\n",
    "- when you slice, you create another list with those variables specified [1:]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Extend: \n",
    "- The extend() function in Python is a list method used to add elements from an iterable (like another list, tuple, or string) to the end of an existing list. It modifies the original list in place, unlike methods like append() which would add the entire iterable as a single element. \n",
    "\n",
    "Insert:\n",
    "- the insert() function in Python is a list method used to add an element at a specific position within a list. It takes two arguments: the index where the element should be inserted, and the element itself. The existing elements in the list are shifted to make room for the new element, without overwriting any data. If the specified index is out of range, it will raise an IndexError\n",
    "\n",
    "Append: \n",
    "- In Python, the append() method is used to add a single element to the end of a list. It modifies the original list in place, increasing its length by one, and does not return any value. The element added can be of any data type, including other lists, which will be added as a single object\n",
    "\n",
    "Map: \n",
    "- The map() function in Python applies a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list or tuple) and returns an iterator that yields the results. It provides a concise way to perform operations on sequences without writing explicit loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter: \n",
    "- The filter() function in Python constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.\n",
    "It takes two arguments:\n",
    "    1. a function\n",
    "    2. iterable (such as a list, tuple, or set)\n",
    "- The function is applied to each element in the iterable, and if the function returns True, the element is included in the resulting iterator. Otherwise, the element is excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zip: \n",
    "- The zip() function in Python aggregates elements from multiple iterables (lists, tuples, etc.) into an iterator of tuples. Each tuple contains elements from the input iterables at the same index. If the input iterables have different lengths, the resulting iterator is truncated to the length of the shortest iterable\n",
    "\n",
    "Reversed: \n",
    "- reversed(sequence) iteraters over x in a sequence, reversed order "
